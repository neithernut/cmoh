Examples
========

This directory contains various examples, each showing off one of CMOHs
features. Every single of the examples does compile and run. In fact, we use
these examples as basic tests.

Most of those examples are based on the class `person`, which is also included
in this directory. The listing below describes the scope of each one of the
examples. Note that some may build on top of each other.

 * `attributes_example.cpp` demonstrates a basic setup for accessing attributes
   statically as well as construction of an object via an accessor bundle.
 * `dynamic_key_example.cpp` demonstrates accessing an attribute in an object
   via a key given at run time.
 * `string_key_example.cpp` demonstrates the use of `cmoh::string_view` for
   property keys.
