Licensing
=========

This library is licensed under the MIT license. Have a look at the LICENSE file
for more information.

The license was chosen because this is an infrastructure project. The primary
intent of the original author was to make his own life, and potentially the life
of others, easier. This also includes future possible work on proprietary
products. Hence, a permissive license was chosen.

We are aware of arguments that permissive licenses would diminish contributions
from corporate projects using that code. This doesn't concern us. This is a
(personal) infrastructure project, a cathedral, not a bazaar. Our goal is not to
attract a large community of developers creeping in a ton of features.

As for corporations which keep fixes or adjustments for themselves while ripping
of the work of others: I have no interest in working with idiots who do not
understand the benefits of sharing the effort of developing and maintaining a
piece of software. Let them write their parallel workarounds and extensions. Let
them experience the pain of maintaining them and eventually being unable to
trivially upgrade to a new version. Let them waste their precious manpower on
that.
